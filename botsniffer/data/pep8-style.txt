Code lay-out

    Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
    Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent [7]. When using a hanging indent the following should be considered; there should be no arguments on the first line and further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a continuation line.
    Yes:

        # Aligned with opening delimiter.
        foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
                                 var_three, var_four)

        # Add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest.
        def long_function_name(
                var_one, var_two, var_three,
                var_four):
            print(var_one)

    No:

        # Arguments on first line forbidden when not using vertical alignment.
        foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
            var_three, var_four)

        # Further indentation required as indentation is not distinguishable.
        def long_function_name(
            var_one, var_two, var_three,
            var_four):
            print(var_one)
